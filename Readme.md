## Problem Statement
Traditional classroom management is manual, error-prone, and inefficient. This project proposes a Smart Classroom Management Software (SCMS) to automate attendance, resource scheduling, and provide data-driven insights, enhancing learning experiences and operational efficiency.

## Solution
This Smart Classroom Management Software is a sophisticated solution designed to revolutionize the educational environment by harmonizing technology with teaching.
This platform creates a dynamic and adaptable ecosystem, responding to the unique needs of each student. With automation, real-time analysis and AI tools both students and educators can be greatly benefitted. 
Educators can prioritize what truly matters by regularly checking insights of students and providing necessary help. This software suite leverages interactive tools, digital resources, and collaborative spaces, all designed to enhance student engagement and creativity.
Key features include facial recognition, providing real-time attendance reports to both educators and students. Additionally, the platform provides resource management, to detect any overlaps of resource usage which may exist while scheduling lectures, checking availability status of various resources.
